# MurmurQuery

MurmurQuery is a PHP class used for querying Murmur servers. It is based on [GT Murmur Plugin](http://www.gametracker.com/downloads/gtmurmurplugin.php), which allows us to query a Murmur server 
without having to install PHP ICE on the web server.

The response is constructed using [Channel Viewer Protocol](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Channel_Viewer_Protocol).

# Requirements

* PHP 5
* [Murmur/Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) 1.2.x+ installed on the server
* [GT Murmur Plugin](http://www.gametracker.com/downloads/gtmurmurplugin.php) installed on the same server on which Murmur is running

# Usage

Check the index.php which comes with this package.
