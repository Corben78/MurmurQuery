# MurmurQuery

MurmurQuery is a PHP class used for querying Murmur servers. It is based on [GT Murmur Plugin](http://www.gametracker.com/downloads/gtmurmurplugin.php), which allows us to query a Murmur server 
without having to install PHP ICE on the web server.

The response is constructed using [Channel Viewer Protocol](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Channel_Viewer_Protocol).

# Requirements

* PHP 5
* [Murmur/Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) 1.2.x+ installed on the server
* [GT Murmur Plugin](http://www.gametracker.com/downloads/gtmurmurplugin.php) installed on the same server on which Murmur is running

# Usage

You can check the index.php file which comes with this package to see how to use this library.

## Setup

First you need to include the library in your PHP scripts where you're going to use it.

`require_once('classes/MurmurQuery.php');`

Then you need to set the configuration. You have two ways of doing it:
* a) Pass in the parameters to the constructor.
* b) Call the `setup()` and pass in the values to it.

a) Create new instance and set the values:

`$murmur = new MurmurQuery($host, $port, $timeout, $format)`

b) Set settings array, create new MurmurQuery instance without parameters and then call the setup() method:

```
// Set the parameters
$settings		=	array
(
	'host'		=>	'127.0.0.1',
	'port'		=>	27800,
	'timeout'	=>	200,
	'format'	=>	'json'
);

// Create new instance
$murmur = new MurmurQuery();

// Load in the settings
$murmur->setup($settings);
```

Note: when calling the setup() method, you can also set the values separately:

`$murmur->setup('127.0.0.1', 27800, 200, 'json');`

### Optional parameters

Not all parameters are necessary. To query a murmur server you only need the host if the server uses default settings. Otherwise you may need to set the port too. Timeout and format parameters are completely optional.

## Querying The Server

Querying the server is as easy as calling the query() method:

`$murmur->query();`

## Handling the response

As soon as you query the server, you have the ability to check the server's status, get full response data etc.

### Server Online Status

```
if($murmur->is_online())
{
	echo 'Server is online!';
}
else
{
	echo 'Server is offline.';
}
```

### Respnse Data

`$response = $mumur->get_status();`

This will return three pieces of information: the users, the channels and original response data.

```
print_r($response['channels']);
print_r($response['users']);
print_r($response['original']);
```

By default the library parses the returned JSON/XML data to an array and pushes extra values (channels and users). However, you can get the raw response by setting raw parameter to `true`:

`$raw_response = $murmur->get_status(true);`

Keep in mind you'll have to parse the data yourself. For example, if you're using json as the preferred format:

```
$raw_response = $murmur->get_status(true);
$data = json_decode($raw_response, true);
```

### Channels

To get the list of available channels:

`$channels = $murmur->get_channels();`

### Users

To get the list of all online users:

`$users = $murmur->get_users();`

### 

# CHANGELOG

## 0.6

* get_response() method now returns already parsed data. However, you can set get_response(true) to get the raw response.
* Added support for getting the channels and users lists separately with get_channels() and get_users() respectively.
